A VSCode extension that brings Claude Code directly into your editor.

## Overview

Claude Code integrates Claude AI into VSCode, providing an interactive coding assistant with conversation history, tool integration, and intelligent code understanding.

## Features

- Interactive chat interface with Claude Code
- Session management and conversation history
- Intelligent file operations and code analysis
- Terminal command execution
- Permission-based tool access
- Support for multiple Claude models
- Real-time streaming responses
- Syntax highlighting and markdown rendering

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the extension
pnpm build

# Package as VSIX
pnpm package
```

Install the generated `.vsix` file in VSCode through Extensions > Install from VSIX.

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

Start the development server with hot module replacement:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will concurrently start:
- Vite dev server (port 5173) for the webview
- esbuild watcher for the extension

### Debugging

Open the project in VSCode and use the debugging configurations:

#### Run Extension
Full build mode without HMR. The extension will be built from scratch before launching.

- Press `F5` or select "Run Extension" from the debug panel
- Suitable for production-like testing

#### Run Extension (HMR)
Development mode with hot module replacement for the webview.

- Select "Run Extension (HMR)" from the debug panel
- Webview changes will reload automatically without restarting the extension
- Faster iteration during development
